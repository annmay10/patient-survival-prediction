# Forecasting the survival of cardiovascular patients during follow-up period

## Dataset

This dataset contains the medical record of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during April-December 2015. The patients consisted of 105 women and 194 men, and their ages range between 40 and 95 years old. All 299 patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction  and had previous heart failures that put them in classes III and IV of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of the stages of heart failure.

## Aim

Using the dataset and the predictors provided, the most statistically significant predictors are selected and we then run logistic regression on these variables to see which variables contribute towards the prediction of the survival of the patient during the follow-up period

## Result

Following a detailed analysis which can be read in the SAS code as well as in the results document, we conclude that  the main predictors were ejection fraction, time of follow-up period, age, and serum creatinine. The finally regression equation can be seen in the paper as well.
